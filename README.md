# NSYNC - Rhythm based iOS game

## Overview
NSYNC is a rhythm-based iOS game where players tap or hold on the screen in sync with the beat of the music, guided by visual animations. The game is built using Swift and utilizes frameworks SpriteKit, GameplayKit, and AVAudioPlayer. Artwork for the game was created using Figma.

## Features 
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The game operates in an infinite loop, with the song speeding up after each iteration, making it more challenging as the player progresses.
- **Visual Cues**: Computer keys are moving horizontally through a ring indicating when the player should tap.
- **Tap detection**: Taps are graded 'perfect' or 'good' with points being added to the score accordingly, or 'fail' where the game ends.
- **Double Points Power Up**: A double points period is triggered when the player achieves a certain number of perfect taps in a row after playing for at least 40 seconds. The number of perfect taps required increases with each double points period.
